        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 lb beyond beef</li>
        <li>2 tbs olive oil</li>
        <li>1 24-oz jar or 3 cups marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the following in a large bowl: mushrooms, onion, 
            parsley, cheese and garlic. Add breadcrumbs, milk, egg, oregano, 
            salt, and pepper. Mix lightly with a fork until just blended. 
            Add beyond beef. Use your hands to mix until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>Form mixture in to 1 Â½ inch meatballs, wetting your hands with 
            water to keep mixture from sticking. 
            Place on a baking sheet so they are not toucan. You should have 16-18 meatballs.
        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat until simmering. 
            Add meatballs in a single layer, working in batches if needed, and 
            cook until browned on the bottom, 3 minutes. Flip meatballs and brown the 
            other side, 3 minutes more. Transfer to large plate (the meatballs will not 
            be fully cooked); repeat with remaining meatballs. Add marinara sauce and 
            bring to a simmer. Gently add meatballs to sauce. 
            Reduce heat to simmer gently until meatballs are cooked through, 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>TO BAKE THE MEATBALLS INSTEAD OF DOING IN PAN:</strong> 
            Place uncooked meatballs on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake on the 
            middle rack at 400F until lightly browned and cooked through, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
