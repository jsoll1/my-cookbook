    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine the flour, 1 tsp salt, sugar, and baking powder and whisk 
            together in a large bowl. Add the oil, then gradually add the water with 
            one hand while mixing ingredients with the other hand. The dough should be 
            smooth and not very sticky. If needed, use more water or flour for desired 
            dough consistence. 
            Place a towel over the dough an allow it to set at room temperature for 
            30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mince ginger, 2 cloves garlic and scallions. 
            Cook in a large saucepan over low heat until soft. 
            Increase temperature to medium-high heat and add crumbled impossible burger. 
            Brown. Until cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add curry powder and frozen peas. Cook for an additional 3 minutes, 
            stirring frequently. Remove pan from heat and season with lime juice and 
            salt. Place mixture in the fridge to cool. Remove from fridge and 
            add 3 tbs of cilantro (finely chopped). Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>
            Place remaining cilantro, mint leaves, 4 cloves garlic, 
            agave or honey, sambal paste, and the 
            juice of 2 limes in a food processor or blender. This sauce is best used fresh.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each into a circle, 
            about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub><sup>th</sup> of an inch thick. The more perfect the circle, the easier 
            it will be to fill. In a skillet over medium heat, toast one side of each dough 
            circle. Once cooled, cut the circles in half to achieve 16 semicircles.
        </li>
        <li>
            With each semicircle, fold the cut, 
            flat edge together and seal with the additional water to make a 
            conical shape with the dough. 
            Fill each cone with approximately 1 tbs of filling. 
            Seal the open edge with water and fold up like an envelope.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry each samosa in oil at 350&deg;F, turning occasionally, 
            until the samosa is golden brown. Remove from the oil and place 
            on a towel-lined platter. 
            Allow to cool for 3-5 minutes and serve with Spicy Mint Cilantro sauce.
