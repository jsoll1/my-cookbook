    <a href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>About 2 pounds ripe, red tomatoes, cored and roughly cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 Italian frying (cubanelle) pepper or another long, light green pepper, 
            such as Anaheim, cored, seeded, and roughly cut into chunks
        </li>
        <li>1 cucumber, about 8 inches long, peeled and roughly cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 small mild onion (white or red), peeled and roughly cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>2 tsp sherry vinegar, more to taste</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup extra-virgin olive oil, more to taste, 
        plus more for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, onion, and garlic in a blender. (if 
            necessary, work in batches.) Blend at a high speed until very smooth, at 
            least 2 minutes, pausing occasionally to scrape down the sides with a 
            rubber spatula
        </li>
        <li>With motor running, add the vinegar and 2 tsp salt. Slowly drizzle in 
            the olive oil. The mixture will turn bright orange or dark pink and become 
            smooth and emulsified, like a salad dressing. If it still seems watery, 
            drizzle in more olive oil until texture is creamy
        </li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a strainer or a food mill, pushing all 
            the liquid through with a spatula or the back of a ladle. Discard the solids. 
            Transfer to a large pitcher (preferably glass) and chill until very cold, at 
            least 6 hours or overnight
        </li>
        <li>Before serving, adjust seasonings with salt and vinegar. If soup is very 
            thick, stir in a few tablespoons ice water. Serve in glasses, over ice, 
            if desired, or in a bowl. A few drops of olive oil on top are a nice touch.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
