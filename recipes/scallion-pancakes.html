    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup boiling water</li>
        <li>7 tbs vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tbs toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>4 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a wooden spoon, mix flour and boiling water in bowl to form rough dough. 
            When cool enough to handle, transfer dough to lightly floured surface and knead 
            until tacky (but not sticky) ball forms, about 4 minutes. 
            Cover loosely with plastic wrap and put in fridge for about 15-20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While dough is resting, stir together 1 tbs vegetable oil, 
            sesame oil, and remaining 1 tbs flour. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Place a 10-inch non-stick pan or a cast-iron skillet over low heat to 
            preheat. 
            Divide dough in 4 parts. Cover dough when set aside. Take one piece. 
            Roll into thin round on lightly floured surface. 
            Use pastry brush to spread oil-flour mixture on surface.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle lightly with salt and scallions. Roll dough into a cylinder.
        </li>
        <li>Brush one edge of the cylinder with oil-flour mixture. 
            Coil cylinder into spiral, tucking end underneath. 
            Flatten spiral with your 
            palm and rollout into 9-inch round or as flat as you can get it.</li>
        <li>Place 1 tbs of oil in skillet and increase heat to medium-low. 
            Place the pancake in skillet. Cover and cook, shaking pancake occasionally 
            until  the pancake is slightly puffy and brown underneath, 1-2 minutes. 
            Drizzle 1 tbs oil over pancake and use pastry brush to distribute. 
            Carefully flip the pancake. Cover and cook until second side is brown, 
            1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the other three dough rounds.</li>
        <li>Serve with Chili Noodle Base sauce.</li>
